                            <p>Mozambique is in its fourth season under Nando’s direct management controlling the country’s production of ABE and general operations. Its base of operation is the MaXamba farm located just outside Marrucune. For the 2021/22 season, the MaXamba farm operated as a commercial farm while also managing an out-grower network to produce ABE. These out-growers were made up of a mix of individual small scale commercial farmers, non-profit and community farming organisations/associations.</p>

                              <p>James Dunkin manages the MaXamba farm, out-growers programme and general community engagements initiated by Nando’s. The operational model and programme implementation are more complex in Mozambique than in other countries due to the farming scheme structure involving out-growers, their labourers, and MaXamba. The Mozambique out-growers can be divided into three distinct categories: Small Scale Commercial Farmers - these are farmers who typically grow ABE (.5Ha+), and other crops on a larger scale than subsistence farmers, and employ full time and part time labour; Organisations – these vary in type, but generally operate as non-profit organisations and/or have a religious or social mission, employ multiple types of people, including those who manage the chilli production, and use ABE income to fund their mandates and/or cover operational costs. These organisations are also generally reliant on multiple funding sources to operate (public, private); and Small-Scale Subsistence/Community Associations - these are made up of subsistence farmers from a specific community, who share land in order to produce ABE. </p>
                              <p>Daniel Lucilio specifically manages the Out-grower programme. The implementation of the programme includes the receipt of seedlings while other inputs are provided by MaXamba for some of the out-growers. MaXamba provides very limited technical support to the farmers regarding ABE production. All harvested fresh ABE is aggregated at the MaXamba Farm, dried, graded, bagged, and shipped to Nando’s processors in South Africa. </p>
                              <p>Since last year’s report, decisions were made by MaXamba, to significantly reduce the number of farmers in two subsistence farmer communities: Tchia and Matchia. This decision was made on the internal agreement that the ideal ratio was four farmers per hectare as farmers from Tchia and Matchia were averaging 0,05HA per farmer previously.  </p>

                              <p>The model used for out-growers, including small and medium sizes and organisational type farmers had a direct effect on the potential impact that could be measured for the 2021/22 season.</p>
                              <p>The complexity of varying land sizes and farm set-ups, ranging from non-profit organisations with a number of growers to individual commercial farmers, meant that a standard commercial analysis for each farmer and community was not possible. The out-growers commercial analysis is better understood based on these categories: Small-scale commercial farmers, Organisations and Subsistence/community association farmers instead of by community, which is used in Zimbabwe and Malawi.</p>
                              <p>The commercial analysis was also more limited than in Zimbabwe and Malawi because all the costs associated with growing ABE per individual farmer or type of farmer could not be determined. Therefore, a net income earned from ABE is not possible to define. Defining what impact occurred from growing ABE was more complex and described in detail in the <a href="/mozambique#impact" target="_blank">impact section</a> of this site.</p>

                              <p>ABE is generally replacing an existing cash crop. These farmers typically have 2+ Ha of land under irrigation and are actively growing multiple crops including ABE. Engaging with this size grower is an issue from an impact perspective for various reasons. Firstly, ABE is generally replacing an existing cash crop. So, the starting point for judging impact is the cash earned from ABE, which is additional to normal earnings, so understanding what crop is being replaced and the income lost versus the new ABE earned is often hard to determine as the farmers usually do not have good records from the past regarding crop sales. This lack of record keeping makes understanding what the farmer earned from ABE impossible. They often know what some of the inputs were that they purchased for the farm but cannot connect those costs directly to ABE production. For example, they may have bought fertilizer twice and know what was spent but have no idea how much of it was applied to ABE versus their other crops. </p>
                              <p>It is difficult to conduct a baseline study and get a proxy for the community across a range of poverty metrics – healthcare, food, education. This is because the farmers are often very different from one another in terms of land size, crops grown, markets accessed, and income earned. They therefore must be considered independently instead of a reflection of the same community. Their unique characteristics mean that farmer samples cannot be used as a reflection of the entire group. Impact can only be determined farmer by farmer instead of by community. This is complex if the farmers change year to year and costly as all the farmers in the programme must be assessed instead of a representative sample. </p>
                              <p>Attributing ABE income is very difficult to determine as these types of farmers typically have multiple and dynamic income sources. The new income earned from ABE is therefore going into a much more complex pot of income and determining attributions like, the farmer is now able to send their kids to a better school because of the ABE income, is very hard to assess. </p>
                              <p>Finally, this size farmer always has consistent temporary or permanent staff, so we need to examine the impact on them, which requires bespoke baseline and impact data collection as we cannot use a community proxy for anything because the circumstances are all different. Again, this is complex if the labourers change year to year and costly as all the labourers in the programme must be assessed instead of a representative sample.</p>
                              <p>While these limitations exist, some potential impact trends are provided which can be used more as a reflection of farmer sentiment about the programme and less verifiable impact, which is explained further in the impact section.</p>

                              <p>The average plot sizes for the smaller subsistence farmers increased from .05Ha to .31Ha. This meant that the average gross income increased from $102 to $1,322. This is an extraordinary increase.  This resulted from a change in policy to focus on fewer subsistence farmers, thus moving those in the programme into a position where ABE can have a meaningfully impact on their lives.</p>

                              <p>As all the ABE is aggregated in MaXamba for drying, some of the farmers want financial assistance from MaXamba as fuel costs are high and some of the farms are more than 60km away.

                              <p>Farmers indicated that the price has not been raised to keep up with inflation and suggested an increase to a minimum of $2 per Kg of fresh chilli. Some farmers also raised the issue of delayed payments from MaXamba, which results in farmers relying on the sale of their less profitable crops to provide for their families.  These delays were not qualified in any instances and should not be considered a reflection of the communication about payment timelines nor performance against those timelines by MaXamba.</p>

                              <p>The small-scale commercial farmers and organisations that are part of the out-grower network typically have permanent and seasonal labour. As they are functioning within one of the poorest countries on the planet and operating at a small scale in comparison to other Agri-producers it is to be expected that they will not always adhere to Mozambique labour law nor international labour standards. To mitigate against this risk, interviews were conducted with labourers that work for the out-growers.  The Impact Amplifier team interviewed the employees of both small-scale farmers and organisations out-growers. A total of 33 employees were interviewed from 16 farmers in 2021/22. Five of these farmers are new farmers in their first season with MaXamba. Based on these interviews, the following reflects some of the potential risks Nando’s and MaXamba have from these two groups of out-growers within its programme.</p>

                              <p>As indicated in the background section for Mozambique, the model used for out-growers, includes small and medium size farmers and different organisational types.  This variance had a direct effect on the impact that could be measured for the 2021/22 season.</p>
                              <p>The complexity of varying land sizes and farm set-ups, ranging from non-profit organisations with a number of growers to individual commercial farmers with permanent labour, meant that a standard community impact analysis was not possible.  In Zimbabwe and Malawi all the farmers are very similar in terms of size of their farms, how much ABE they grow, other cash crops, commercial opportunities available, irrigation in place, public infrastructure, inputs used, and technical support provided.  These consistencies allow a single farmer to be reflective of the entire community.  </p>
                              <p>In Mozambique it is difficult to conduct a baseline study and get a proxy for the community across a range of poverty metrics (healthcare, food, education) because the farmers are often very different from one another in terms of land size, crops grown, markets accessed, income earned and location. These farmers therefore must be considered independently instead of a reflection of a community. Their unique characteristics mean that farmer samples cannot be used as a reflection of the entire group. Impact can only be determined farmer by farmer instead of by community. This is complex if the farmers change year to year and costly as all the farmers in the programme must be assessed instead of a representative sample. </p>

                              <p>To assess impact an alternative approach has been used for Mozambique, which mimics the commercial analysis undertaken. The approach separates the farmers into three types: Small-scale commercial farmers, Organisations and Subsistence/community association farmers instead of by the community where they farm. These groupings, while useful as a framework to understand production will take multiple seasons to gather enough data to measure and score impact as every farmer must be baselined and then impact measured specifically for them against that baseline. Instead of scoring the impact the following reflects what was gleaned from farmer interviews regarding the ABE contribution to their basic human needs over the 2021/22 growing season.</p>

                              <p>These farmers typically have 2+ Ha of land under irrigation and are actively growing multiple crops including ABE. Engaging with this size grower is an issue from an impact perspective for various reasons. Firstly, ABE is generally replacing an existing cash crop. So, the starting point for judging impact is the cash earned from ABE, which is additional to normal earnings, so understanding what crop is being replaced and the income lost versus the new ABE earned is often hard to determine as the farmers usually do not have good records from the past regarding crop sales. </p>
                              <p>Secondly, this lack of record keeping makes understanding the farmer’s net ABE earnings also challenging. They often know what some of the inputs were that they purchased for the farm but cannot connect those costs directly to ABE production. For example, they may have bought fertilizer twice and know what was spent but have no idea how much of it was applied to ABE versus their other crops. </p>
                              <p>Finally, attributing ABE income to any kind of social impact is very difficult to determine as these types of farmers typically have multiple and dynamic income sources. The new income earned from ABE is therefore going into a much more complex pot of income and determining attributions like, the farmer is now able to send their kids to a better school because of the ABE income, is very hard to assess and verify.</p>
                              <h3>Impact</h3>
                              <p>In 2021/22, impact interviews were conducted with 7 of 16 small scale commercial farmers. These farmers reported the following impact from growing ABE. As it relates to Education – 1 of 7 farmers spent ABE earnings on supporting their eight children’s school fees. Heath Care – 1 of 7 farmers spent ABE earnings to save a small amount for medical emergencies. Housing - 1 of 7 farmers spent ABE earnings to paint their house. Food Security – 2 of 7 farmers reported spending ABE earnings on food, primarily on more protein. Energy – none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on energy costs. Water - 2 of 7 farmers reported spending a small amount of their ABE earnings on paying their water bills. Effluent - none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on effluent costs.</p>

                              <p>Beyond the complexities of measuring impact outlined for small scale commercial growers an area that is even more exaggerated for organisational growers is the issue of ABE income attribution. Organisations generally have more sources of income than small-scale commercial growers. As such, determining what the ABE income was spent on is generally not known. It has not been accounted for separately, meaning that the administrators do not know how it was spent on their operational costs, which are separate from other income sources. Therefore, determining which impact originated from the ABE income is difficult to measure. </p>
                              <h3>Impact</h3>
                              <p>In 2021/22, impact interviews were conducted with 2 of 2 organizational growers.  Despite the complexity of ABE income attribution based on verified records kept, impact was able to be successfully measured for this season.  </p>
                              <p>The two organisaions were Missao Sao Frumenzio/Domenico and Real Dream Community Centre.</p>
                              <p>At Missao Sao Frumenzio/Domenico the money earned from ABE made up 80% of all income earned by the Mission over the 12-month cycle examined.  The ABE income allowed the organisation to employ labour and provide capital for the farming of a large variety of crops used to feed school children in the region. These crops included a range of vegetables such as onion, potato, beans, beetroot, lettuce, okra and carrots as well as fruits such as papaya, mango and grapefruit. Of all crops farmed by Missau, 50% were donated to schools and the other 50% were sold in the community. 30% of fruit yields were processed to create jam and this jam was also sold to the community markets.  Thus, the ABE earnings were exclusively used to promote food security in the region.  </p>
                              <p>The Real Dream Community Centre is an orphanage which supports 38 children/young adults who live on site and an additional 40 who are foster children placed with families in the community. These children and young adults being supported by the Orphanage are aged between 2 to 27 years. Although the main source of the organisation’s operational costs are provided by Individual Donors/Sponsors, income earned from ABE contributed roughly 15% of the organisation’s operational expenses.  While direct attribution for the ABE income could not be confirmed it is safe to assume that this income allowed Real Dream to support 12 children/young adults (15% of total) with food, shelter and educational costs as per the Centre’s core functions. </p>

                              <p>These farmers are generally smaller in scale – less than 1ha of irrigated land, have limited cash crops and ABE generally makes up a large portion of the household income. Impact is therefore easier to measure than the other two groups. However, this group of farmers in the Peri-Farms programme in Mozambique are not uniform. Many of these farmers have other cash crops and other sources of household income like wages. As such, ABE attribution has been challenging to document.  This will improve over time as individual baseline assessments are compared to the change documented post growing ABE for multiple seasons.</p>
                              <h3>Impact</h3>
                              <p>In 2021/22, impact interviews were conducted with 5 of 6 subsistence farmers in Mozambique (some subsistence farmers are in associations which have multiple members growing ABE so there are more than 6 farmers in this category, the total however could not be verified). These farmers reported the following impact from growing ABE. As it relates to Education – none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on education costs. Heath Care – none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on health care related costs. Housing - 2 of 5 farmers spent ABE earnings to paint their house and buy furniture. Food Security – 3 of 5 farmers reported spending ABE earnings on food, primarily on more protein and providing for the ability to buy in bulk. Energy – 1 of 5 farmers reported spending a small amount of their ABE earnings on paying their monthly electricity bill. Water – none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on water costs.  Effluent - none of the farmers reported spending any ABE earning on effluent costs.</p>
