Inflation rates continue to be erratic and averaged over 200% in the calendar year 2022. There are also artificially state based USD to Zimbabwe exchange rates, which devalue the money paid to the farmers via Kacholo. Farmers were allowed more consistent access to the money in their bank accounts than in previous years, but only in Zimbabwe dollars (RTGS). Farmers were paid in USD, but when removed from the bank as RTGS the exchange rate is typically 75% of the trading value. This exchange rate loss and hyperinflation had a significant impact on one of the core benefits of the programme, namely a 'fixed price' per kg of chili, based in USD.</p><h3 class=\"is-highlighted\">Labour Costs</h3><div class=\"rich-text-with-icons w-richtext\"><figure class=\"w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-imag\"><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/peri-hand-1.png\"></div></figure><p>This season the cost of labour varied substantially between the three communities being assessed. This variance was based on two primary factors: Price of labour and when labour was used.</p><p>Labour costs are considered in two parts, the first is before chilli is harvested where labour isbeing used to prepare the land, plant seedlings and tend to the chill bushes while growing, this timeframe is deemed the growing season. The second labour costs are incurred when the chilli is being harvested. As it is sold fresh, harvesting and selling in a timely fashion is critical to the farmers income thus, they use most labour to help them harvest. Across the various communities&#x27;, day labour harvested roughly 75% of all chilli grown. What differed dramatically between communities was the cost of labour. In all three communities, labour was paid based on productivity, not time.</p><p>The day labour was compensated by the 20 litre bucket of chilli harvested. This bucket price varied between $1 at the lowest and $1.82 at the highest. This was principally a factor of labour availability and employment opportunities in the areas where production occurred. The second key factor was the use of labour during the growing season. Historically, very few farmers have used labour during this period, but this season, for unknown reasons, they did particularly in Birchenough where labour was used by a large number of farmers interviewed. These differences accounted for an overall increase in the cost of labour from the previous season.</p></div>"

Within the context of Zimbabwe's current economic climate, the ABE farmers are considerably more financially stable than other farmers in the areas visited. For farmers who have been in the programme over a number of seasons improvements and sustaining these improvements is greatly appreciated.</p><h4>Technical Support and Inputs:</h4><p>Training and inputs continue to be highlighted as the primary drivers of success for farmers. As the programme grows each season to include new farmers, those that are in their first season were greatly appreciative of the training and demonstrations facilitated by the Field Extension Officers. The training sessions found most beneficial by the farmers were on fertiliser application, harvest management and record keeping.</p><h4>Additional Income Sources:</h4><p>Farmers who have been growing ABE for an extended period are beginning side projects for additional income. Farmers indicated being able to buy more livestock (cattle, chickens, goats and turkeys). Some farmers indicated buying scotch-carts which have improved their overall access to transport and often renting out their scotch-carts to those that need them in their community.</p>"

The vast majority of farmers suggested that a portion of their overall income be paid in US$ cash.</p>h4>High labour costs: </h4><p>Farmers indicated that seasonal Labour costs were very high this season, and these labourers typically want to be paid in US$ for their labour. Farmers have also requested extra cash loans for the paid labourers particularly towards the peak harvesting months.</p><h4><strong>Assistance With Protective Clothing:</strong></h4><p> Due to the handling of fertilizers and in some instances pesticides, farmers are increasingly requesting assistance with work suits, gumboots and gloves to use when out in the field.</p><h4>Provision of Additional Dryers: </h4><p>The capacity of the driers often does not support all the volume of the yields. When the driers are full, some farmers have to rely on drying the chilli outside and during periods of extending rain, this often leads to increased rotting and crop loss.</p>"
