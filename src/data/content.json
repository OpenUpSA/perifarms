The programme is supervised by Martin Bebete and Josaphat Mutsambwa with support from a team of dedicated field extension officers in each region.</p><p>Across all regions, Kacholo provided inputs, such as seedlings, fertiliser and pesticides, on credit to the farmers. Although Kacholo recommended which and how many inputs to take, farmers decided for themselves what they wanted. Kacholo also stipulated a fixed $.8 rate per kg for fresh chillies in the contract signed with farmers. Per the Kacholo field extension officers they provided an average of 20 hours of group and individual training to the farmers. However, the farmers perceive the training received to have been an average of 8 hours. Continued emphasis has also been placed by Kacholo on encouraging children to attend school rather than working in the fields during planting and harvest periods.</p><p>The planting density was 25,000 plants per Ha across all regions, but plot sizes varied between growing areas, cultivating ABE on plot sizes between .05Ha - .64Ha. The Zimbabwe government only permits 10-20% of a farmer's land to be designated for cash crops with the balance for family consumption to ensure farmer food security.</p></div>"

There are also artificially State based USD to Zimbabwe Dollar (KWL) exchange rates, which continues to devalue the money paid to the farmers. Although the price per kg of ABE sold was contracted in USD, based on the Zimbabwe currency exchange laws, when farmers withdraw from their bank accounts it is paid in ZWL at a State defined exchange rate which is dramatically lower than the retail or commonly used rate.Kacholo was able to successfully pay 75% of farmer payments directly in USD and 25% in ZWL. This exchange rate loss on a percentage of the farmers income and hyperinflation continued to have a significant impact on the farmers spending power.</p>"

													"title": "Labour Vs. Plot Size Vs Yield",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "<p>The cost of labour continued to vary substantially between the three communities being assessed. This variance was based on two primary factors: Price of labour and when labour was used.</p><p>Labour costs are considered in two parts, the first is before chilli is harvested where labour is being used to prepare the land, plant seedlings and tend to the chill bushes while growing, this timeframe is deemed the growing season. The second labour costs are incurred when the chilli is being harvested. As it is sold fresh, harvesting and selling in a timely fashion is critical to the farmers income, thus, they use most labour to help them harvest. Across the various communities, day labour harvested between 80-90% of all chilli grown. What continued to differ dramatically between communities was the cost of labour and the application of paid labour versus average plot sizes and ABE production. In all three communities, labour was paid based on productivity, not time.</p><p>The day labour was compensated by the 20-litre bucket of chilli harvested. In 2022/2023, this bucket price was $1 in Fuve, $1.5 in Ruware and $2 in Birchenough. This variance was principally a factor of labour availability and employment opportunities in the areas where production occurred. The second key factor was the use of labour during the growing season. Historically, very few farmers have used labour during this period, but for the last two seasons, for unknown reasons, they did, particularly in Birchenough where labour was used by a large number of farmers interviewed. These differences accounted for an overall increase in the cost of labour from the previous season. 74% of Birchenough farmers used paid labour during the growing season, compared to 24% and 48% of farmers in Ruware and Fuve respectively. While Birchenough average plot sizes are the smallest of the three communities at .167Ha, compared to .176Ha in Fuve and .178Ha in Ruware it continues to have the highest yields.</p>"

The first is that Kacholo (country partner) ended the 2023 season early and stopped buying from farmers in April in one location and May in two others. The season normally runs till 1 August. As farmers still had ABE to harvest and sell they lost this additional income for the season after already investing in most of the annual costs.

												{
													"title": "Successes",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "<p>Zimbabwe continues to be the largest producer of ABE with the most smallholder farmers involved. The key successes noted for this season were:</p><h4>Programme Appreciation:</h4><p>Although cash is constantly mentioned as a challenge, all farmers are appreciative of the PERi-Farms programme. Within the context of Zimbabwe's current economic climate, the ABE farmers are considerably more financially stable than other farmers in the areas visited. For farmers who have been in the programme over a number of seasons improvements and sustaining these improvements is greatly appreciated.</p><h4>Technical Support And Inputs:</h4><p>Training and inputs on credit continue to be highlighted as the primary drivers of success for farmers. The inputs on credit are material because most farmers do not have the working capital needed to fund the costs of growing ABE prior to harvesting. Additionally, new and seasoned farmers in the programme still appreciate the training and demonstrations facilitated by the Field Extension Officers. The training sessions found most beneficial by the farmers in the 2022/2023 were land preparation, fertiliser application, harvest management and record keeping. The training for ABE production, also was deemed valuable for increasing the yields of the farmers' other subsistence and cash crops.</p><h4>Provision of Additional Dryer:</h4><p>In the previous season, farmers had mentioned that there was increased ABE rotting due to mist and rain from having to dry some of the ABE outside and the capacity of the dryers could not support all the ABE harvested. In 2022/2023 a new dryer was purchased, and this challenge has been resolved successfully.</p>"
												},
												{
													"title": "Challenges",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "<p>The following reflects some of the challenges mentioned in the farmer and management interviews that did affect both earnings and impact:</p><h4>Season Ending Early</h4><p>Farmers noted repeatedly that ending the season in April and May, two to three months, prematurely, materially affected their net income as they had planned their input purchases and labour allocations with the expectation of the season ending in August.</p><h4>Fixed Price/Kg:</h4><p>The price paid to farmers for ABE has remained constant for three years, while all their other costs have increased. Thus, reducing their potential net income. This was mentioned as a material issue repeatedly by the farmers.</p><h4>High Labour Costs:</h4><p>Farmers indicated the cost of labour continues to be a material issue for them which fundamentally affects their net income. Farmers requested extra cash loans for paying labour during the harvesting period.</p><h4>Banking Challenges:</h4><p>Farmers were previously using CAPS bank, which did not charge fees or cash-out charges. However, they were switched to a new bank that imposed monthly fees. This change in banking services has increased operational costs for the farmers. The reasons for the change are too detailed to enumerate here, but farmers are presently allowed to choose their own bank providers, however, this as a cost centre should still be reviewed to ensure it is minimised.</p><h4>Birchenough Attrition</h4><p>At the end of the 2022/23 season 43% of the Birchenough farmers left the programme. This level of attrition has never happened in the 9 year history of the programme. While we don't know for certain all the reasons, it is likely the season ending early, the banking charges, the high labour costs and the price remaining constant. This area has more economic opportunities than the other two in Zimbabwe, thus enabling farmers more production choices. As this is so significant it should be closely watched as it may have material repercussions on the entire programme's long term.</p>"

The value perceived from technical support also decreased considerably from 49% last season to 41%. The value perceived from inputs on credit has increased significantly from 27% last season to 36%. These changes continue to be an important reflection of the macroeconomic conditions the farmers operate within, and how Kacholo can continue to support them.</p>"

													"title": "",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "To provide another perspective on how the ABE farmers have been impacted by the addition of this cash crop it is relevant to understand their access to education, energy and food security in relation to other subsistence farmers in Zimbabwe.  These three factors are critical because: being food secure allows the farmers and their children to focus on other productive measures - education, commercial gain, and social connections; energy access which provides  lights and charging facilities enables studying and commercial activities after dark; and, children's education is a tool for realising new commercial opportunities other than subsistence farming or becoming more efficient and effective at farming. As these impact metrics are vital to understanding change, this section reviews the access to education that ABE farmers' children have, their household access to energy, as well as their food security in relation to the Zimbabwean country norms.</p><h4>Education</h4><h5>Percentage of age appropriate children in primary school</h5><p>The latest data available from 2020 on what percentage of age appropriate children are in primary school is 86.36% in Zimbabwe. Thus 13.64% of children are not in school, however this statistic only refers to those not enrolled not counting those enrolled but not attending regularly.</p><h5>Percentage of children that complete primary school</h5><p>In Zimbabwe, around 89% of children complete primary school according to UNICEF's data for 2021 (UNICEF Zimbabwe Education Fact Sheets, 2021). There are however disparities between genders, with girls having a slightly higher completion rate (around 92%) compared to boys (around 86%) [International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa].</p><h5>Percentage which go to and also complete secondary school in Zimbabwe</h5><p>Secondary school has two levels in Zimbabwe, lower which is grades 8-11 (O level) and upper which is grades 12-13 (A level). As of 2021, 71% of children who completed primary school enter lower secondary school, however of those who entered, the average completion rate is only 54% which drops to 40% for rural areas. In Zimbabwe there are a range of tertiary degrees that only require an O level like teaching, and most other technical degrees. To enter university however, an A level is required.  Only 15%, which drops to 6% for rural areas, complete upper secondary school. (<a href='https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zimbabwe-MICS-EAGLE-Education-fact-sheets-2021.pdf'>See here</a>).</p><h5>Percentage in university</h5><p>The latest available tertiary education enrollment rate, 2020, was 9.72% of both O and A level graduates. Roughly 7-8% of the Zimbabwe population have  tertiary education, that rate drops to 3-4% in rural areas.</p><p>The vast majority of ABE Zimbabwean farmers have children that attend an educational institution which fall into either the primary (5-13 years), secondary (14-18 years) or university educational phase (19-25 years). At the primary school level a high 96% of Zimbabwean farmers children are attending, for secondary school a high 84% are attending, and for university 58% eligible for university are attending.</p><p>The ABE farmer children are attending secondary school and university at much higher rates than the country average and particularly high in comparison to rural areas.</p><h4>Energy</h4><h5>Percentage of Zimbabwe electrified and has solar in rural areas</h5><p>While there's no single definitive figure, estimates suggest that between 40% and 53% of Zimbabwe's population has access to electricity. This access rate for Zimbabweans includes both rural and urban areas, with a significant disparity between urban (78 -86% access) and rural areas (14 -16% access).  While these percentages are a range, so too is the daily availability of electricity for those who have it ranging between 4-12 hours per day.   Counted in the rural figures for having access to “electricity” includes those with a solar system which further confuses the facts.  The estimations of how many people in rural communities have access to solar power ranges between 10-20%.</p><p>(<a href='https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZW'>https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ZW</a>).<br/>(<a href='https://www.se4all-africa.org/seforall-in-africa/country-data/zimbabwe/'>https://www.se4all-africa.org/seforall-in-africa/country-data/zimbabwe/</a>)<br/>(<a href='https://www.techzim.co.zw/2021/09/46-zimbabwe-electricity-users-use-solar-as-main-source/'>https://www.techzim.co.zw/2021/09/46-zimbabwe-electricity-users-use-solar-as-main-source/</a>)</p><p>While the ABE farmers reflect close to the national average for electrical connections at 13%, the percentage which have solar energy is substantially above the rural average.  69% of ABE farmers have solar power for lighting and charging in their homes giving them a level of power access which is materially better than the rural and country norm.</p><h4>Food Security</h4><p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system provides a five-phase acute food insecurity scale.  The IPC Acute Food Insecurity Scale allows for the classification of acute food insecurity at both the household and area level using a scale of 1- Minimal food insecurity to 5 - Famine.  Per the Global Report on Food Crisis (GFRC), Zimbabwe has been defined as being in a  major food crisis considering that as of December 2022, annual food price inflation was estimated at 285% due to reliance on food imports as well as currency depreciations in the country. The extent of the crisis affects  3 - 3.5M people in  Zimbabwe who  were projected to be in IPC Phase 3 or above reflecting the persisting effects of economic and weather shocks on household food access and availability (FEWS NET, 2022)(FEWS NET, February 2023).</p><p>This crisis phase was consistent among the Birchenough, Ruware and Fuve, areas where ABE is grown. These areas  have all been classified as acutely food insecure and in what is defined as crisis mode for 2023 from the same report.</p><p>In the ABE impact assessment, food security considers animal ownership, the balance of protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins/minerals found in the farmers' diets, as well as the variety within food groups.</p><p>The chart below considers food regularly purchased and food grown for consumption by Zimbabwean farmers. Good variety indicates 6 or more food types per food group, moderate indicates 3 to 5 food types and inadequate indicates 2 or less food types per food group. The farmers have most of their variety concentrated in the various carbohydrates they consume at a 14.75% good variety rate, followed by proteins at 6,56% good variety rate. Therefore  21.31% of farmers consume 6 or more types of proteins and carbohydrates regularly. Almost half of the farmers (48%) have an inadequate variety of protein however, with the most consumed protein coming from beans and chicken. The most consumed carbohydrate is maize, in the form of porridge or sadza. When it comes to vitamins and minerals, the most consumed are from \"vegetables\" which refers to leafy greens such as kovo, rape or pumpkin leaves. Fats/oils have the least variety with farmers purchasing cooking oil and typically consuming ground nuts.</p>"

The programme is managed by Duncan McDavid who supervised all aspects of the programme including farm visits, programme coordination, technical skills training by the FEOs and farmers, and the drying process.</p><p> Tropha's small scale farmers are growing ABE in one region, across different irrigation blocks. The irrigation system has been successfully installed by Tropha at no cost to the farmers. There was been no charge to-date for water, however, in the future farmers will be required to pay for pumping water and general maintenance monthly. The land has been allocated to the farmers through negotiations by Tropha with the primary chiefs in the area. Of the 120Ha of land allocated to Tropha, 63Ha was allocated to produce Nando's ABE across. Generally each ABE farmer has 1Ha of irrigated land, with an average of .22Ha allocated to ABE. The Tropha Farmers will be able to increase their ABE production, based on success, up to .4Ha of land.</p><p>Farmers growing ABE were provided inputs on credit, technical skills training, and a guaranteed price per kg of dry ABE. Inputs were allocated based on an average of .22 Ha plot size and were provided at cost with no additional charge for transportation. All new farmers are supplied with chemical inputs with the Tropha team doing the spraying of crops in the first season, and farmers spraying themselves from their second season onwards. Sprayers are bought by individual farmers or at a community level. Protective PPE clothing is supplied on loan from Nando's for farmers who opt to do their own spraying in the second season.</p><p>During 2022/2023, farmers received quarterly group training sessions from FEOs, lasting roughly two hours each. According to the FEOs, group training and one-on-one coaching totalled sixteen hours over the season, however, according to farmer's perceptions, the total training time totalled eleven hours. The focus of the technical skills training included the fundamentals of farming in the classroom with practical in-field observations, covering topics such as seed beds, land preparation, transplanting, pests and disease management, harvesting and grading.</p>"

													"content": "<p>Only 59% of the farmers covered earned a net income in the 2022/23 season. The rest lost money due to crop damage from floods caused by heavy rainfalls. More than 75% of the farmers affected by the heavy rainfall were in the community of Chikwawa. Some of the farmers who were affected by the floods were able to still grow other crops such as maize and soya beans which were sold at local markets and used for personal consumption. As reported by FEOs, in a reasonably good season, A-grade ABE average yields are roughly 90%, however, in 2022/2023 it was only 47%. Farmers sold B and C grades to Tropha while the rest of the lower grade ABE was sold in local markets. Most farmers reported losses from those sales as the chilli was sold fresh and rotted within a short time. For those farmers that lost money growing ABE, where the cost of inputs taken on credit from Tropha exceeded revenue earned from ABE sales, were not required to pay their debt this season. That debt was suspended until the 2023/24 season when ABE revenue is expected to exceed costs as well as earn a profit for these farmers.</p>"

													"title": "Malaga ABE",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "<p>In addition to Nando's ABE variety, Tropha also provided inputs and support to the small farmers for Malaga ABE production, which was sold to Nando's for managing heat levels in its sauces. Thus, farmers were growing two varieties of chilli for Nando's and could not make a clear distinction about their sources of income and costs between the two varieties.  To accommodate this lack of clarity, some of the data reflected in this report - income, costs, and impact reflect the combination of these two chilis. While other data like land size and yields only relates to ABE. As the farmer income and impact were materially affected by the floods, combining the chilli data together, when done, has created very little distortion because the amount of income (average $30 gross income) and its related impact from growing Malaga was marginal.</p>"
												},
												{
													"title": "Labour Costs",
													"type": "text",
													"content": "<p>The labour costs between the two communities varied dramatically, thus the averages distort the data. Labour is considered in two parts, the first is before chilli is harvested where labour is being used to prepare the land, plant seedlings, and tend to the chilli bushes while growing, thus this timeframe is deemed the growing season. The second is when the chilli is being harvested. Farmers always incur a higher labour cost for harvesting as it is more time sensitive and requires more people working at once to prevent crop loss. ABE is sold dry to Tropha, thus each farmer must take the responsibility of all post-harvest handling until the point of sale to Tropha.</p><p>In the 2022/2023 season, on average, both communities used similar amounts of paid labour for both growing and harvesting, however, farmers in Katowo paid $.87 for each bucket (the most common method of payment) harvested by paid labour while Chikwawa paid $1.67 per bucket. This disparity was based on the location. Katowo is much more isolated than Chikwawa and therefore there are less opportunities, so people are prepared to work for less than in Chikwawa.</p>"

Both farmers and the FEOs indicated there were no additional prevention and damage control measures they could have implemented.</p><h4>Revenue And Net Income</h4><p>Both the average gross income and average net income declined from the previous season, decreasing by 62% and 94% respectively.</p><h4>Higher price per kg</h4><p>Due to increasing costs of living and inflation, most of the farmers are still requesting an increase of the price per kg to $3.50 per kg.</p><h4>Poorer seedling quality for this season</h4><p>In the previous season 8% of farmers indicated that the seedlings were lower quality and were more prone to drying out and rotting compared to the previous season. This was still a challenge for 5% of the farmers in this season.</p><h4>Fertiliser application changes</h4><p>Many of the farmers reported receiving less than adequate fertiliser and attributed some of their failures to that. The FEOs explained that this was a misunderstanding as the same amount of fertiliser had been provided per plot size; however, it was applied only on one side of the raised bed ABE is grown in as opposed to both sides as had been done in the past.</p><h4>Side-selling</h4><p>FEOs indicated that in this season an estimated 20% of farmers sold their A-grade chilli to external vendors who may have offered them higher prices. Tropha has reiterated to farmers that side-selling will result in removal from the programme.</p>"

													"content": "<p>To provide another perspective on how the ABE farmers have been impacted by the addition of this cash crop it is relevant to understand their access to education, energy and food security in relation to other subsistence farmers in Malawi. These three factors are critical because: being food secure allows the farmers and their children to focus on other productive measures - education, commercial gain, and social connections; energy access which provides lights and charging facilities enables studying and commercial activities after dark; and, children's education is a tool for realising new commercial opportunities other than subsistence farming or becoming more efficient and effective at farming. As these impact metrics are vital to understanding change, this section reviews the access to education that ABE farmers' children have, their household access to energy, as well as their food security in relation to the Malawi country norms.</p><h4>Education</h4><h5>% of age appropriate children not in primary school in Malawi</h5><p>According to data from UNICEF, in Malawi over 10 percent of school-aged children do not attend primary school, this statistic does not however specify whether it applies specifically to rural populations.</p><h5>% of children that complete primary school</h5><p></p>The net enrolment rate in primary school is around 88% in Malawi, however only 27% of children complete primary education in rural areas <a href='https://education.gov.mw/index.php/edu-resources/2022-education-statistics'>(Unicef, 2022; Ministry of Education Malawi Statistics, 2022)</a>.</p><p>The dropout rate from primary school is particularly high, with 74% of pupils not completing a full course of primary schooling in Malawi overall. This rate is even higher among girls due to factors like early marriages and pregnancies <a href='https://www.pedagogy4change.org/education-of-girls-in-malawi/'>(Pedagogy for change)</a>. <a href='https://education.gov.mw/index.php/edu-resources/2022-education-statistics'>According to the Ministry of Education 2022 Education Statistics Report</a> about 44 % dropped out of primary school because of poverty (unspecified).</p><h5>% which go to and also complete secondary school in Malawi</h5>*note the distinction between rural and urban are not available for Malawi<p>In Malawi, the transition rate from primary to secondary school is approximately 16%​ <a href='https://www.nyasatimes.com/the-challenge-of-low-enrolments-in-malawis-higher-education-system/'>(Nyasa Times)</a>​.This indicates that a relatively small fraction of children who complete primary education proceed to secondary education.</p><p>The dropout rate of girls in secondary education increased from 6.4% in 2020 to 9.5% in 2021. For many girls, dropping out is common due to child marriage and teen pregnancy, with a 50% child marriage rate, and 29% teenage pregnancy rate (Unicef, 2022).</p><h5>% in university</h5><p>Malawi has one of the lowest university enrolment rates in the world, with less than 1% of college-age individuals attending university. This is considerably lower than the African average of 12% and the global average of 33% <a href='https://www.nyasatimes.com/the-challenge-of-low-enrolments-in-malawis-higher-education-system/'>(Nyasa Times)</a>.</p><p>The vast majority of ABE Malawi farmers have children that attend an educational institution which fall into either the primary (5-13 years), secondary (14-18 years) or university educational phase (19-25 years). At the primary school level, a high 98% of Malawian farmers children are attending, for secondary school 78% are attending, and for university 87% eligible for university are attending.  The university attendance level is exceptionally high and is likely an aberration based on the sample of farmers interviewed.  This is likely to decrease as more data is gathered in subsequent years.</p><p>The levels of school participation for ABE farmers in Malawi far exceeds the country norms at the primary, secondary and university levels.</p><h4>Energy</h4><p>Per the World Bank in 2022, 14.2% of Malawi is electrified, while only 5.6% is electrified in rural areas. Per a University of Michigan, School for Environment and Sustainability study in 2023 roughly 7% of rural households are electrified and 20% of rural homes have solar power.</p><p>More than half of the ABE farmers (58%) have access to solar for lighting and charging in their households. This solar consists of solar powered torches and lamps. Additionally, 10% of households are connected to the electrical grid.</p><p>The combination of solar power and grid based connections demonstrates that ABE farmers in Malawi are meaningfullymore energy secure than the rural country norms.</p><h4>Food security</h4><p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system provides a five-phase acute food insecurity scale. The IPC Acute Food Insecurity Scale allows for the classification of acute food insecurity at both the household and area level using a scale of 1- Minimal food insecurity to 5 - Famine. Per the Global Report on Food Crisis (GFRC), Malawi has been defined as being in a major food crisis in all editions of the Report since 2017, largely due to the impact of weather extremes on harvests, high food prices and low household purchasing power.</p><p>The Chikwawa and Katomo areas where ABE is grown have been classified as acutely food insecure and in what is defined as crisis mode for 2023 from the same report. These two areas generally fall into the Phase 2 and 3 classifications which are:</p><p>In the ABE impact assessment, food security considers animal ownership, the balance of protein, carbohydrates, and vitamins/minerals found in farmers' diets, as well as the variety within food groups.</p><p>The chart below shows that 43% of farmers in Malawi have good protein intake. Carbohydrate intake was considered moderate to good for 75% of farmers, and vitamin/mineral intake was considered good for only 23% of farmers.</p><p>This chart also factors in food regularly purchased and food grown for consumption. Good variety indicates 6 or more food types per food group, moderate indicates 3 to 5 food types and inadequate indicates 2 or less food types per food group. Farmers have more variety when it comes to proteins and carbohydrates consumed. 17,5% of farmers consume 6 or more types of proteins and carbohydrates. The most consumed protein comes from fish and beans, the most consumed carbohydrate is maize, consumed in the form of porridge or sima. When it comes to vitamins and minerals, the most consumed vitamins are from \"vegetables\" which refers to leafy greens such as pumpkin leaves. Fats/oils have the least variety with farmers acquiring fats and oils from cooking oil, and in some cases margarine and ground nuts.</p><h5>Animal ownership</h5><p>Every farmer growing ABE owns at least one animal, however owning one animal does not provide any real food security. For animals to contribute toward food security farmers need to own multiple animals. The chart below shows that the most popular animals owned by ABE farmers in Malawi are birds such as chickens and pigeons, followed by larger animals such as pigs and goats.</p><p>The combination of food consumed and animal ownership demonstrates that ABE farmers in Malawi are meaningfully more food secure than the country and regional norms.</p><p>While a direct causal relationship cannot be made between the increased levels of food security, access to energy and education from growing ABE and its related income. However, there is a strong and distinct correlation between the introduction of ABE as a new cash crop and the improvement of each of these metrics.</p>"

It is also the longest time from when they last earned any money from crop sales from the previous season. This period is considered the “hunger season”. The balance of protein, carbohydrates, vegetables and fruits eaten indicated sufficient intake of carbohydrates, as well as protein. The amount of vitamins and minerals from fruits and veg, as well as fats and oils were however not well balanced. On a community level 50% of farmers in Chikwawa indicated they do not have enough to eat, compared to 30% of farmers in Katowo.
