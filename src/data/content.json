The programme is supervised by Martin Bebete and Josaphat Mutsambwa with support from a team of dedicated field extension officers in each region.</p><p>Across all regions, Kacholo provided inputs, such as seedlings, fertiliser and pesticides, on credit to the farmers. Although Kacholo recommended which and how many inputs to take, farmers decided for themselves what they wanted. Kacholo also stipulated a fixed $.8 rate per kg for fresh chillies in the contract signed with farmers. Per the Kacholo field extension officers they provided an average of 20 hours of group and individual training to the farmers. However, the farmers perceive the training received to have been an average of 8 hours. Continued emphasis has also been placed by Kacholo on encouraging children to attend school rather than working in the fields during planting and harvest periods.</p><p>The planting density was 25,000 plants per Ha across all regions, but plot sizes varied between growing areas, cultivating ABE on plot sizes between .05Ha - .64Ha.

This variance was based on two primary factors: Price of labour and when labour was used.</p><p>Labour costs are considered in two parts, the first is before chilli is harvested where labour is being used to prepare the land, plant seedlings and tend to the chill bushes while growing, this timeframe is deemed the growing season. The second labour costs are incurred when the chilli is being harvested. As it is sold fresh, harvesting and selling in a timely fashion is critical to the farmers income, thus, they use most labour to help them harvest. Across the various communities, day labour harvested between 80-90% of all chilli grown. What continued to differ dramatically between communities was the cost of labour and the application of paid labour versus average plot sizes and ABE production. In all three communities, labour was paid based on productivity, not time.</p><p>The day labour was compensated by the 20-litre bucket of chilli harvested. In 2022/2023, this bucket price was $1 in Fuve, $1.5 in Ruware and $2 in Birchenough. This variance was principally a factor of labour availability and employment opportunities in the areas where production occurred. The second key factor was the use of labour during the growing season. Historically, very few farmers have used labour during this period, but for the last two seasons, for unknown reasons, they did, particularly in Birchenough where labour was used by a large number of farmers interviewed. These differences accounted for an overall increase in the cost of labour from the previous season. 74% of Birchenough farmers used paid labour during the growing season, compared to 24% and 48% of farmers in Ruware and Fuve respectively. While Birchenough average plot sizes are the smallest of the three communities at .167Ha, compared to .176Ha in Fuve and .178Ha in Ruware it continues to have the highest yields.</p>"

Within the context of Zimbabwe's current economic climate, the ABE farmers are considerably more financially stable than other farmers in the areas visited. For farmers who have been in the programme over a number of seasons improvements and sustaining these improvements is greatly appreciated.</p><h4>Technical Support And Inputs:</h4><p>Training and inputs on credit continue to be highlighted as the primary drivers of success for farmers. The inputs on credit are material because most farmers do not have the working capital needed to fund the costs of growing ABE prior to harvesting. Additionally, new and seasoned farmers in the programme still appreciate the training and demonstrations facilitated by the Field Extension Officers. The training sessions found most beneficial by the farmers in the 2022/2023 were land preparation, fertiliser application, harvest management and record keeping. The training for ABE production, also was deemed valuable for increasing the yields of the farmers' other subsistence and cash crops.</p><h4>Provision of Additional Dryer:</h4><p>In the previous season, farmers had mentioned that there was increased ABE rotting due to mist and rain from having to dry some of the ABE outside and the capacity of the dryers could not support all the ABE harvested. In 2022/2023 a new dryer was purchased, and this challenge has been resolved successfully.</p>"

Thus, reducing their potential net income. This was mentioned as a material issue repeatedly by the farmers.</p><h4>High Labour Costs:</h4><p>Farmers indicated the cost of labour continues to be a material issue for them which fundamentally affects their net income. Farmers requested extra cash loans for paying labour during the harvesting period.</p><h4>Banking Challenges:</h4><p>Farmers were previously using CAPS bank, which did not charge fees or cash-out charges. However, they were switched to a new bank that imposed monthly fees. This change in banking services has increased operational costs for the farmers. The reasons for the change are too detailed to enumerate here, but farmers are presently allowed to choose their own bank providers, however, this as a cost centre should still be reviewed to ensure it is minimised.</p><h4>Birchenough Attrition</h4><p>At the end of the 2022/23 season 43% of the Birchenough farmers left the programme. This level of attrition has never happened in the 9 year history of the programme. While we don't know for certain all the reasons, it is likely the season ending early, the banking charges, the high labour costs and the price remaining constant. This area has more economic opportunities than the other two in Zimbabwe, thus enabling farmers more production choices. As this is so significant it should be closely watched as it may have material repercussions on the entire programme's long term.</p>"

This is demonstrated by the limited amounts of protein consumed on average, as well as the high prevalence of carbohydrates versus vegetables and fruit. Additionally, it appears in how many farmers are regularly hungry and experience a “hungry” season. 40% of the farmers interviewed indicated they did not have enough to eat on a regular basis, but it was particularly acute between September - January when the crops they grow have the lowest harvests. Finally, farmers are spending on average $294 of their ABE earnings on food, a proportionally high amount based on the average net incomes.</p>"

The irrigation system has been successfully installed by Tropha at no cost to the farmers. There was been no charge to-date for water, however, in the future farmers will be required to pay for pumping water and general maintenance monthly. The land has been allocated to the farmers through negotiations by Tropha with the primary chiefs in the area. Of the 120Ha of land allocated to Tropha, 63Ha was allocated to produce Nando's ABE across. Generally each ABE farmer has 1Ha of irrigated land, with an average of .22Ha allocated to ABE. The Tropha Farmers will be able to increase their ABE production, based on success, up to .4Ha of land.</p><p>Farmers growing ABE were provided inputs on credit, technical skills training, and a guaranteed price per kg of dry ABE. Inputs were allocated based on an average of .22 Ha plot size and were provided at cost with no additional charge for transportation. All new farmers are supplied with chemical inputs with the Tropha team doing the spraying of crops in the first season, and farmers spraying themselves from their second season onwards. Sprayers are bought by individual farmers or at a community level. Protective PPE clothing is supplied on loan from Nando's for farmers who opt to do their own spraying in the second season.</p><p>During 2022/2023, farmers received quarterly group training sessions from FEOs, lasting roughly two hours each. According to the FEOs, group training and one-on-one coaching totalled sixteen hours over the season, however, according to farmer's perceptions, the total training time totalled eleven hours. The focus of the technical skills training included the fundamentals of farming in the classroom with practical in-field observations, covering topics such as seed beds, land preparation, transplanting, pests and disease management, harvesting and grading.</p>"

The second is when the chilli is being harvested. Farmers always incur a higher labour cost for harvesting as it is more time sensitive and requires more people working at once to prevent crop loss. ABE is sold dry to Tropha, thus each farmer must take the responsibility of all post-harvest handling until the point of sale to Tropha.</p><p>In the 2022/2023 season, on average, both communities used similar amounts of paid labour for both growing and harvesting, however, farmers in Katowo paid $.87 for each bucket (the most common method of payment) harvested by paid labour while Chikwawa paid $1.67 per bucket. This disparity was based on the location. Katowo is much more isolated than Chikwawa and therefore there are less opportunities, so people are prepared to work for less than in Chikwawa.</p>"
